# GraphQL
What you will find here are projects and initiatives under taken to contribute to or build upon work done by the [GraphQL project](https://github.com/graphql).

The first project will be a visioning effort to capture the status quo of the problem space addressed by the [GraphQL Composite Schemas Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg). Visioning includes defining personas that represent current categories of developers attempting to implement composite schemas through schema stitching, federation or other stratgies. The next step will be to collect user stories across companies who have deployed these solutions or are currently working to build them. User stories will then be combined into applicable personas. Each step will be published in this repo and all conversations will be recorded video when possible. At the end the goal is to have a relatively complete picture of the status quo and existing problems to be fixed in through the development of an open source specification which is the work of the [GraphQL Composite Schemas Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg).

A second phase of this work will be capturing the desired features for a shiny future, also presented as user stories. This initiative represents a large efffort, but it is my belief that once a set of user stories are published that this work will be adopted by the GraphQL Foundation adding additional engineering resources to complete it.

Finally, analysis of the status quo compared to the shiny future will generate a roadmap of needed features. At this point, builders of the specification can determine priorities for delivering a shiny future for GrapphQL Composite Schemas.
